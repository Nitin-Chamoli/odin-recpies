        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <em>
                This savory porridge, breakfast fare in South Indian kitchens, is my childhood favorite. 
                </br>A bit like polenta but made with creamy wheat cereal, it brings absolute satisfaction during my down-and-out days.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <em>
                <li>¼ cup ghee</li>
                <li>1 cup uncooked creamy wheat cereal, not instant (such as Cream of Wheat)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ghee</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon black or yellow mustard seeds</li>
                <li>¼ cup raw cashews</li>
                <li>2 dried chile de arbol peppers, stemmed</li>
                <li>1 large carrot, cut into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
                <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
                <li>10 medium fresh curry leaves (Optional)</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                <li>3 cups water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
                <li>¼ cup water (Optional)</li>
            </em>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <em>
                <li>Melt 1/4 cup ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour in creamy wheat cereal; toast, stirring frequently, until light brown and nutty-smelling, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Wipe the skillet with a paper towel.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons ghee in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add mustard seeds; cover and wait until seeds stop popping (like popcorn), about 30 seconds. Add cashews and chiles; stir-fry until nuts are golden brown and chiles blacken, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in carrot, peas, curry leaves, and turmeric; stir-fry about 2 minutes. Stir in 3 cups water and the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, covered, until carrots are fork-tender, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in toasted cream of wheat. (It will instantly absorb liquid and begin to swell.) Cover and cook until fully softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; let stand, covered, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in remaining 1/4 cup water if desired for a creamier texture. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve warm.</li>
